# Retro Gadgets Documentation
Retro Gadgets is a gadget creation station where you invent, build, solder, code and customise your own electrifying gadgets then share them with the world.

This repository contains the documentation for doing anything code-related in Retro Gadgets.  
You can find [the official documentation here](https://docs.retrogadgets.game), although it might not be of much use (yet)

* [Buy the game here!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730260/Retro_Gadgets/)
* [Join the Official Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/np6FUDjt9E)
* [Learn how you can contribute by opening a pull request!](./docs/github/Contributing.md)

### Coding gadgets
Retro Gadgets uses Luau to code gadgets, which is basically Lua but [with some differences](https://luau-lang.org/compatibility). You can still use resources for learning Lua and apply that knowledge to Luau. Here are some places to learn Lua (and Luau):

* [Lua documentation](https://www.lua.org/start.html)
* [Learn X in Y minutes, where X=Lua](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/)
* [Roblox Luau documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting/luau)
* [Luau documentation](https://luau-lang.org/library)

## Okay... how do I get started?
Well, [buy the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730260/Retro_Gadgets/) if you haven't done that already.
