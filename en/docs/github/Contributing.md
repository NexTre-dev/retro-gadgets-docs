# Contributing

If you'd like to help out, there are a few ways you can contribute.

## Contributing to the Documentation

To get started with editing the documentation:

1. Fork the [documentation repository](https://github.com/NexTre-dev/retro-gadgets-docs).
2. Edit pages or make improvements, such as adding examples, writing guides, or improving descriptions.
3. Open a pull request back to the original repository.

From then, make any changes to your PR if necessary. It'll be merged when all issues or comments have been resolved.

> Any changes you push to the branch of the pending PR will be added to the PR automatically.

> ⚠️ By default, GitHub grants anyone who can merge pull requests write access to the branch you open a PR from.

Changes are synced to the viewer once every day around `12:30am PST`.

### Remark on style
API documentation (and most things that fall under docs) should be written in a clinical but casual tone. Take a look at other pages for examples on how to style markdown for known API sections, such as Methods or Events.
> Do not stress too much over style, it will be corrected in most instances during the PR process, and is not enforced rigorously. In a similar matter, while you should avoid having spelling or grammar mistakes, don't feel afraid of contributing if you think your spelling or grammar is sub-par. PRs are a collaborative process, and any contributions are appreciated.

Guides (and guides that appear in remarks of module documentation) are exempt may be written in whatever style you want, so long as it is respectful.

**Retro Gadgets is accessible to all ages. Please act appropriately.**

## Contributing a Theme

It is recommend you first read the [Themes section of the viewer's README](https://github.com/kurmachu/retro-docs-site#themes) for more information on using the viewer repository, requirement for themes, and how to set them up. The general outline is roughly:

1. Fork the [viewer GitHub repository](https://github.com/kurmachu/retro-docs-site).
2. Write your theme, using the [Arithm default theme](https://github.com/kurmachu/retro-docs-site/blob/master/themes/default/arithm.css) as a reference.
3. Go to the "themes" folder in your repository and select the appropriate folder for your theme. For example, if your theme is dark, you would place it in the "dark" folder.
4. Open a PR to get your theme merged.
